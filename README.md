# SocialInfluenceModel

## Supplemental Information
---
### Included Python Files
- run.py: execute this file from the terminal to launch the model (ensure model.py and server.py are in a sub-folder titled 'SocialInfluenceModel')
- model.py: the model class, various agent classes, and requisite functions
- server.py: the MESA visualization suite to produce a browser-based GUI

### Known Issues
- All agents that aren't the influencer start hardened
- Server.py is not displaying resilient agents in blue, either on network or in chart
- Regarding the above, I think the hardened agents may be conflicting, but both are in data collector
